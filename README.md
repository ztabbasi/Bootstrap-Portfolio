# Bootstrap-Portfolio
portfolio

what is done :
I have added a NAV bar which has links to about (index), contact and portfolio page

not completed :
to add margins in case the screen is medium or large.
psuedocode:  if the screen is small or xtra small (iphone etc), do not add any margins
else add margins boths on the left and right hand sides.

learned :
how to use bootstrap so no css code needs to be written for most styles.  only add a link
to cdn and look up on bootstrap webpages to get an example of what is needed.
